# COLOR FLOW

- This is a clone of Floodit, a popular game where you try to flood a grid of random colors in the fewest tries. 

- The player chooses from a palette of colors above the grid. Whatever color is chosen, it replaces the top left square and recursively all of its adjacent squares that share the same color. 

- Player wins if she can eliminate the entire board under the maximum amount of allowed tries.

- Requires pygame and python2 to run
