EDIT:   Final score sometimes not right; still needs fixing.
EDIT 2: Final score fixed, plus a few polishes.
EDIT 3: Pygame brought in. Implemented a simple version of the game graphically.

Prototyping an idea for a game.

-There is an nxn 2D array with a random color (number) in each cell. 

-When the game is run, player will be prompted to choose from a range of colors (1 - 7). 

-The chosen color (number) replaces the color of the upper leftmost (0, 0) cell of the grid, as well as any of its two adjacent cells (right and bottom) if they have the same color as the first. This process is repeated recursively, until all same-color cells that happen to be connected with the first cell are changed into the chosen color. 

-Goal of the game is to "white out" the board in the fewest amount of tries.

-So far, the basic mechanic has been implemented for console usage. Next step is developing the UI with (preferably) Pygame.
